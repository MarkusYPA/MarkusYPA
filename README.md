# About me

<!-- **MarkusYPA/MarkusYPA** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

- 🌱 I’m currently (fall 2024 - summer 2026) studying coding at grit:lab on the Åland islands located between Finland and Sweden. We start off with Go, then move on to JS and after that we get to choose between Rust and Java. The school follows the 01-Edu curriculum.
- 👯 I did publish a game on Steam called [Hyzer Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293000/Hyzer_Sky/) that focuses on my other passion, disc golf 😀
